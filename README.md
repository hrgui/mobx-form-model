# @hrgui/mobx-form-model

**API is still unstable, and it may change wildly!**

Yes, another attempt to bind mobx and forms, again. 

I really like the API from [formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) but I also do like [mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx). However, with formik, a lot of the logic ends up baked into the component, which makes it tied to React.

See [./packages/mobx-form-model/README.md](./packages/mobx-form-model/README.md) for more details.
